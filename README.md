# Fold Client Bukkit SDK
Easy to use Bukkit API for interacting with Fold Client users.

## Features
Allows you to;
- Disable mods/features on your server
- Send Fold Client notifications
- Enable/disable staff mods for your staff
- Access to all client<->server packets

## Limitations
This public SDK does not allow you to properly tell if somebody is on Fold Client, or if that they are anticheat protected.

In our philosophy, servers should not be able to differentiate between anti-cheat protected and unprotected users. We do not want to replace
the server-side anticheat, we want to strengthen the entire system.
